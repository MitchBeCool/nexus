It's maybe fifteen meters up from the surface of the lake.
Or maybe it's a large river? No idea.

It's nice.

:: EXTRA KNIVES SITUATION {"position":"9450,5500","size":"100,100"}
<!--The additional Knives situation.

This must be accounted for since I do believe it would be cheap not to have knives in the trunk of his car.

this is in reference to:

[Are you hurt? one]
[What?! two]


if you have the go bag, and you get the trunk items and you fight, then you lose the machete but have all the extra knives, including knife3. (unless you pump the gas)

however, if you don't have the go bag and you also get the trunk items, then you lose knife3.

In either case, you have a burnt hand because you have the trunk items.

It's not possible to have the pink backpack if you have the trunk items.

Therefore, if you have the go bag, and also find the pink backpack it is possible to then still run into the giant zombie from the road because that branch is only for having the go bag (but technically you don't have the pink backpack, you only have the items from it.)
But there has to be something different if you have the pink backpack items...
If you have the pink backpack but not the go bag then you'd have to have hot-wired the car - but that is the other branch without the bag on this.

If you have the pink backpack items and the go bag then it's possible you hot-wired the car, but not guaranteed. -->

:: NOTES - Direction on Mid/Hard road into Houston {"position":"11750,2300","size":"100,100"}
<!--//But if he did leave on foot from the city, and he battled the zombies with an umbrella, he defeats the bear and this somehow leads to some perk you would normally not get. ($outalive)// - This would mean you have the pink backpack and not the trunk items that is the only way this is possible.
//But it is possible to get here without leaving the city on foot and you'll have the trunk items minus the knife3 (possibly). (this is because you don't have the go-bag) In either case, the player is a risk taker while also playing it "safe" in the beginning.// - This should have some kind of perk too but perhaps only if you chose to make the spear early on and therefore have the stake too? ($TheOpportunisticGambler)

But this is also a bad thing because you get said perk yet you use up all your food and water after you get on the bike or go through the forest.
This will have consequences later...somehow.

With the bicycle he gets to Houston at dusk?

This allows him to find additional supplies and a relatively secure place to sleep.  And as he is preparing to sleep he sees the faint light from someone's fire or light in a house.

If you investigate at night, you die.

As night falls it's more and more apparent that a major storm is coming.

A hurricane hits early in the morning and Wyatt is forced to flee Texas and head north to escape the rising waters and battering wind.

If he stays in the city he must get to higher ground, and in so trying he always dies.  The miracle is that he can get out of the city for the most part.  There are situations that get him killed though.

Because the storm hits he isn't able to investigate the light, but as he finds a weathered solar powered car to use, he sees the woman on the side of the road, he decides to pick her up like a hitchhiker.

It's awkward and weird. And even more strange that she is even more insane than you thought Wyatt ever was.  Wyatt starts to pick up on it but he decides to help her get to where she was going in the first place.
But this leads to her betrayal of Wyatt and then the game switches to the perspective on the woman (It can last the rest of the day until night time.) 

When Wyatt comes back in and is forced to kill her at some point.
Right away?
The next day?
(Perhaps someone from another group sees him do it; if he waits until the next day then that influences whether or not they accept him into their group later?)

Or he lets her go and she comes back to kill him, but he is prepared and he kills her instead?
-->



:: NOTES 1 {"position":"13150,5350","size":"100,100"}
<!--Not having the machete is a no, no.

No matter how you slice it.

There should be a punishment and perhaps another injury that prevents even trying to save the little girl while getting into the city?

Also, when does the machete get set to false...and same with the other knives in this situation? Which knives are even possible to get stuck here?

-->


:: NOTES 3 {"position":"13150,4950","size":"100,100"}
If player chooses to go back to the highway, he runs into the giant zombie?

His escape from that will pretty much be the same as it is if he hadn't avoided it to begin with. (without realizing it of course)

And if he chooses the woods, he will lose his bag somehow and get to the city on foot once it's already really dark and cold and windy and ominous. 

There is still one shell left in the shotgun in this scenario, as well as all 5 bullets or 2 bullets of the magnum (depending on how previous decisions were made.)


Perhaps he should be forward to the giant zombie sequence with the bag on the easy road now?
Or the hard road. 
If it's the hard road, I'll have to write in some more lines and some code to avoid battling the bear again.


Similarly, if player instead went with the bike and just finished jumping off the bridge, then that should lead into a bear sequence, likely from the mid road since there the bag isn't a factor.


:: NOTES on this section {"position":"14900,2500","size":"100,100"}
<!-- If player has the Trunk Items in this situation it means that he has a burnt hand AND he doesn't have knife3 (possibly), there is no other way to have any knives (aside from the swiss army knife) and get to this situation because one doesn't have the go bag in this situation. -->


:: NOTESs {"position":"13100,7300","size":"100,100"}
<!--There should be some kind of perk and some kind of negative for not killing the bear.

Avoiding it.
Taking the safe route. Perhaps this makes him try to be more daring next time?
-this kills him if he has a burnt hand, but the bear doesn't find him to kill him if he took a bath in the lake.

Maybe he can take on more zombies now that he has killed the bear, and if he didn't then he has to flee or he'll die.

Unless he made it out of the secondary town.  Then that'll make up for it?

But if he's done Both of those things then he can earn some kind of achievement?
- done with Unbreakable achievement.

<!-- It's possible to have the spear and the five finger rings knife[trench kinfe](knife2), but not both in addition to the smaller stake.
Meaning, if you have the spear then you can have the stake, but not knife2.
And if you have knife2 you can't have the stake along with the spear, only the spear.

The reason I did this is for ease of story progression. If you have the stake or you have the knife, you have a melee attack or secondary weapon with the spear being the primary.  And when the spear breaks you still have a weapon. -->

:: Welcome Information {"position":"925,1700","size":"100,100"}
Welcome to Nexus:

The story, once coded properly, is meant to be played in real-time on any mobile device, including but not limited to, an Apple Watch or similar devices. It's also meant to be one continuous stream of information, like texting, not in different passages as this prototype is presented.

Therefore, pay no attention to '...forward to...'s as the actual game will not have them. Same with the wait times on |Wyatt is...| situations. Actual game play will not disclose how long players will be waiting for Wyatt to respond next.
Part I takes place over the course of about two days.
(However, during beta testing, all wait times are ignored but usually indicated so you can understand what it will be like to play it.)

The manual saving of the game is strictly for this beta-version. When completed, the app will auto-save and going backward will not be permitted, aside from using lives; that is, until the player has beaten the game. (the back button in the browser will only make the game completely restart - all items and achievements will be lost - unless you have a saved state.)

Return to the Main Menu at any time to review stats and settings, such as: lives, inventory, player name, energy level, and adult language options.

You can also make notes about your progress or how you feel about the game or questions you have in the Journal section. If there is a typo you can referrence the name of the passage that is displayed at the top of each new page.  Just be sure to click save when you go back to the menu or the game.

Save and Restore your game as necessary, but try not abuse the save function to cheat death since it won't provide an accurate testing basis for the real app. The save button and restore button are there incase you can't play the game in one go, and require breaks, or accidentally close the window.
The browser will take care of the saved state in the cache automatically, even on mobile devices, once you click 'Save.'
(Lives, energy level, and inventory and so forth will be a menu side pop-out in the real game.) 

May you and Wyatt become the best of pals.
Enjoy!
